# NetSpecter: Future Features & Enhancements Ideation

This document outlines potential features and enhancements for **NetSpecter**, tailored to its target audience: Network Engineers, Penetration Testers, Security Auditors, and System Administrators. The ideas below are categorized by the distinct professional domains and skillsets they serve.

---

## 🏗️ 1. Full-Stack & Architecture (@javascript-pro, @senior-fullstack)

As a modern Electron/Node.js application, NetSpecter can leverage advanced web technologies to create a more resilient, extensible, and performant platform.

*   **Plugin Architecture (Extensions API):** Create a secure, sandboxed Plugin API (using Node's `vm` module or WebAssembly) allowing the community to write custom parsers, themes, and scan tools without modifying the core app.
*   **Background Service Workers:** Implement background scanning via hidden Electron renderer processes or Node `Worker Threads` to run scheduled scans without locking the main UI thread.
*   **GraphQL/REST Local API Server:** Expose a local, authenticated API endpoint so users can trigger scans or pull JSON results programmatically via `curl` or external automation scripts.
*   **Real-Time Collaborative Dashboard (WebRTC):** Allow multiple pentesters on the same engagement to sync their scan data and findings in real-time over a local P2P WebRTC connection.
*   **Memory Profiling & Large-Scale Data Handling:** Implement virtualized scrolling (e.g., `react-window` style) and SQLite (`better-sqlite3`) to replace flat JSON files, enabling the UI to smoothly handle enterprise networks with 100,000+ hosts.

## 🌐 2. Network Engineering (@network-101, @network-engineer)

Deepening the application's understanding of Layer 2 and Layer 3 topologies to provide holistic network visibility.

COMPLETED   **VLAN Hopping & Tag Detection:** Detect misconfigured trunk ports and attempt to identify 802.1Q VLAN tags traversing the wire.
COMPLETED   **SNMP Walking & MIB Parsing:** Full integration for SNMPv1/v2c/v3. Automatically walk target devices to pull routing tables, interface statistics, and exact hardware firmware versions.
COMPLETED   **Topology Mapping (Graph View):** Transform the flat list dashboard into an interactive visual topology map (using D3.js or Cytoscape) showing routers, switches, endpoints, and their logical subnets.
COMPLETED   **PCAP Packet Capture & Analysis:** Integrate `libpcap` bindings. Allow users to right-click a host and run a live 60-second Wireshark-like packet capture to detect cleartext credentials or anomalous traffic.
COMPLETED   **Rogue DHCP/DNS Detection:** Actively listen for and flag rogue DHCP servers handing out incorrect IP ranges or unauthorized DNS servers performing spoofing.

---

## 🛡️ 3. Security Auditing & Compliance (@security-auditor, @pic-compliance)

Features designed to automate the boring parts of an audit, ensuring networks meet stringent industry standards (like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or CIS).

*   **Automated Compliance Reporting (PCI-DSS & CIS):** Map open ports and TLS versions directly to compliance failures. E.g., Flagging TLS 1.0 or plain-text FTP (Port 21) as immediate PCI-DSS violations.
*   **Audit Trail & Secure Logging:** Implement an immutable, cryptographically signed log of every action taken within the app (scans run, IP targets, timestamps) for legal/engagement CYA (Cover Your Assets).
*   **One-Click Report Generation:** Export findings into highly polished, executive-ready PDF, HTML, or CSV reports. Include remediation steps mapped to CVEs.
*   **Certificate Lifecycle Management:** A dedicated dashboard specifically for monitoring SSL/TLS certificates across the network, highlighting self-signed certs, weak cipher suites (e.g., RC4, DES), and imminent expirations.

---

## ⚔️ 4. Offensive Penetration Testing (@scanning-tools, @pentest-checklist, @pentest-commands)

Empowering Red Teams with unified, frictionless exploitation and enumeration workflows.

*   **Hydra/Medusa Brute-Force Wrappers:** GUI integration for standard dictionary attacks against SSH, FTP, SMB, and HTTP Basic Auth. Allow users to load custom wordlists (e.g., `rockyou.txt`).
*   **Metasploit RPC Integration:** Connect directly to a local `msfrpcd` daemon. Automatically suggest and queue specific Metasploit exploit modules against newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   **Automated Reverse Shell Listener:** A built-in terminal tab listening on specific ports (e.g., `nc -lvnp 4444`) with copy-to-clipboard reverse shell one-liners tailored to the target's OS.
*   **SMB/NFS Share Enumeration UI:** A visual file-explorer style interface for browsing open Windows SMB shares or Linux NFS mounts without needing to drop to the CLI.
*   **Web Directory Fuzzing:** Integrate a built-in `ffuf` or `dirb` equivalent for discovered web servers, hunting for `.git/`, `wp-admin/`, and exposed `.env` files.

---

## 🔍 5. Advanced Hardening & Application Security (@security-scanning-security-hardening, @security-scanning-security-sast)

Bridging the gap between network positioning and application-layer security posture.

*   **Continuous Delta Monitoring (Hardening Mode):** Run scheduled diffs against previous baseline scans. Alert the user immediately if a new, unauthorized port suddenly opens or a new device connects to the Wi-Fi.
*   **Default Credential Spraying:** Automatically pass a small list of known IoT default credentials (e.g., `admin/admin`, `root/toor`, `cisco/cisco`) against HTTP/Telnet/SSH interfaces of newly discovered hardware.
*   **Container & Cloud Enumeration:** Detect if hosts are Docker containers or Kubernetes nodes. Look for exposed internal Kubelets (Port 10250) or Docker daemon sockets (Port 2375).
*   **Live Traffic Interception (MiTM Proxy):** A module to perform local ARP spoofing to intercept HTTP traffic, capturing basic authentication tokens for forensic demonstration (requires strict user opt-in/warnings).

## 🕷️ 7. Web Application Vulnerability Scanner (Burp Suite Parity)

NetSpecter currently operates at the **network/transport layer** (L3/L4): port scanning, banner grabbing, TLS handshakes, and CVE matching via Nmap. Burp Suite operates at the **application layer** (L7), dissecting HTTP request/response cycles to find logic flaws in web applications themselves. To achieve parity, the following capabilities would need to be built.

### 7a. Intercepting HTTP/S Proxy (Foundation)

This is the single most critical piece. Every Burp Suite feature is built on top of an in-line Man-in-the-Middle proxy that captures, displays, and allows modification of HTTP traffic in real-time.

*   **Local Proxy Server:** Embed a Node.js HTTP/HTTPS proxy (using `http-mitm-proxy` or `node-http-proxy`) that the user configures their browser to route traffic through. NetSpecter dynamically generates and trusts a local Root CA to decrypt TLS traffic on-the-fly.
*   **HTTP History Logger:** Every request/response pair flowing through the proxy is logged chronologically in a searchable, filterable table (equivalent to Burp's **Logger / HTTP History**). Support filtering by host, status code, MIME type, response length, and regex on body content.
*   **Request Interception & Modification:** An "Intercept" toggle that pauses outgoing requests, displaying them in an editable raw text view. The user can modify headers, cookies, query parameters, and POST body payloads before forwarding them to the server (Burp's **Proxy > Intercept** tab).
*   **WebSocket Interception:** Extend the proxy to capture and display WebSocket frames (`ws://` and `wss://`), allowing inspection and modification of real-time application messaging.

### 7b. Automated Web Crawling & Attack Surface Mapping

*   **Passive Spider (Sitemap Builder):** Passively build a hierarchical sitemap tree from all URLs observed flowing through the proxy. No active requests are made; the tree grows organically as the user browses.
*   **Active Crawler:** An active headless browser crawler (using Puppeteer or Playwright) that recursively follows links, submits forms with dummy data, and discovers hidden pages. Handles JavaScript-rendered SPAs that traditional HTTP crawlers miss entirely.
*   **Content Discovery / Forced Browsing:** A built-in wordlist-driven directory brute-forcer (equivalent to `ffuf`/`dirb`/Burp's Content Discovery) that fuzzes for `.git/`, `/admin/`, `/.env`, `/wp-config.php.bak`, etc.
*   **API Schema Detection:** Automatically detect and parse OpenAPI/Swagger endpoints (`/api-docs`, `/swagger.json`) to map every available REST API route and its expected parameters.

### 7c. Active Vulnerability Scanner (The Core Engine)

This is Burp Suite's primary commercial value. Each vulnerability class requires its own dedicated detection module with targeted payloads.

*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Inject time-based blind (`SLEEP(5)`), error-based (`' OR 1=1--`), and UNION-based payloads into every discovered input vector (query params, POST fields, cookies, headers). Detect database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, SQLite) from error fingerprints.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Test reflected, stored, and DOM-based XSS by injecting canary strings (e.g., `"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) and checking if they appear unescaped in the response DOM.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Inject internal URLs (`http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`, `http://localhost:6379/`) into URL-accepting parameters and detect if the server fetches them.
*   **XML External Entity (XXE):** Submit crafted XML payloads with external entity declarations (`<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">`) to XML-accepting endpoints.
*   **OS Command Injection:** Inject shell metacharacters (`` `id` ``, `; whoami`, `| cat /etc/passwd`) into input fields and detect command execution via time delays or output reflection.
*   **Path Traversal / LFI:** Fuzz file path parameters with `../../etc/passwd` and `....//....//etc/passwd` variants to detect local file inclusion.
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** Detect Java, PHP, and Python serialized objects in cookies/parameters and attempt known gadget chain payloads.
*   **Broken Authentication Testing:** Detect missing rate limiting on login forms, test for username enumeration via response timing/content differences, and flag missing `Secure`/`HttpOnly`/`SameSite` cookie attributes.
*   **CORS Misconfiguration Detection:** Send requests with `Origin: https://evil.com` and flag if the response reflects it in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`.
*   **HTTP Header Security Audit:** Check every response for missing `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Permissions-Policy` headers.

### 7d. Manual Testing Utilities

*   **Repeater (Request Editor):** A dedicated tab where the user can take any captured request, manually edit every aspect of it (method, URL, headers, body), and re-send it to the server, inspecting the raw response side-by-side. Essential for manually validating scanner findings.
*   **Intruder (Automated Fuzzer):** Mark specific positions in a request template with payload markers (e.g., `§username§`). Load wordlists and automatically iterate through thousands of values, displaying response length/status/time in a sortable results table. Support attack types: Sniper, Battering Ram, Pitchfork, and Cluster Bomb.
*   **Sequencer (Token Entropy Analyzer):** Capture thousands of session tokens, CSRF tokens, or password reset tokens and perform statistical randomness analysis (FIPS, chi-squared, spectral) to flag insecure token generation.
*   **Decoder/Encoder Utility:** A multi-tab encoding workbench supporting Base64, URL encoding, HTML entities, Hex, Gzip, JWT decode, Unicode escaping—with chained transformations (encode as Base64 → then URL-encode the result).
*   **Comparer (Diff Tool):** Visual side-by-side diff of two HTTP responses to detect subtle differences (e.g., comparing a valid login response vs. an invalid one to identify enumeration vectors).

### 7e. Out-of-Band & Advanced Detection

*   **Collaborator Server (OAST):** Run a local DNS/HTTP callback server (similar to Burp Collaborator or `interactsh`). Inject unique callback URLs into payloads to detect blind SSRF, blind XXE, blind SQLi, and DNS exfiltration where no in-band response is visible.
*   **DOM Invader (Client-Side Testing):** Inject a JavaScript agent into the proxied page that traces DOM sources and sinks in real-time, automatically detecting DOM-based XSS, prototype pollution, and postMessage vulnerabilities.
*   **GraphQL Introspection & Testing:** Automatically detect GraphQL endpoints, run introspection queries to enumerate the full schema, and test for injection, authorization bypass, and excessive data exposure on each resolver.

## 🧩 8. Architecture Recommendation: Single App, Multi-Workspace UI

### Decision: One Unified Application

Rather than splitting NetSpecter into two separate products (e.g., "NetSpecter" for network scanning + "AppSpecter" for web app testing), the recommended approach is a **single Electron application with a workspace-based UI switcher**.

### Rationale

**The Pivot Workflow.** In a real engagement, the analyst's workflow constantly crosses layer boundaries:

1. Discover a host with open port `8080` in the **Network** workspace (L3/L4)
2. Immediately pivot to the **Web App** workspace to launch an intercepting proxy against that host's web application (L7)
3. Find a SQLi vulnerability, pivot back to **Network** to check what other ports are open for lateral movement

If these are separate applications, the user constantly has to copy and paste IPs and loses context between two windows. That friction destroys the unified value proposition that makes NetSpecter unique.

### Proposed UI Structure

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🌐 Network    🕷️ Web App    🔧 Utilities           │  ← Top-level workspace switcher
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│   (Completely different UI per workspace)             │
│                                                      │
│   Network:  Host grid, port cards, topology map      │
│   Web App:  HTTP history, proxy intercept, repeater  │
│   Utilities: Decoder, Comparer, Sequencer            │
│                                                      │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each workspace swaps the entire UI context, but the **data layer remains shared**:

- A host discovered in Network mode is immediately available as a target in Web App mode
- Vulnerability findings from both layers aggregate into one unified report
- One shared SQLite database backs all scan results, HTTP history, and engagement data

### Architecture Benefits

| Concern | Single App | Two Separate Apps |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Sharing** | Hosts, vulns, and scan results in one shared store | Requires IPC bridge, file import/export, or shared DB |
| **Pivot Speed** | Right-click host → "Open in Web Scanner" instantly | Alt-Tab, copy IP, paste into second app |
| **Install & Updates** | One installer, one auto-update cycle | Two apps to install, version, and update independently |
| **Design System** | Shared glassmorphic CSS, same component library | Duplicated UI work or a shared npm package |
| **IPC Layer** | Existing `ipc.js` channel system naturally extends | Separate preload scripts, separate channel registries |
| **Codebase Complexity** | Modular workspaces within one `src/renderer/` | Two full Electron apps with duplicated boilerplate |
| **Brand Positioning** | "NetSpecter covers L3–L7" — stronger market story | Fragmented product identity |

### When Separate Apps Would Make Sense

The only scenario justifying a split would be **separate commercial licensing** (e.g., selling a "Network Edition" and a "Professional Edition" independently). Since NetSpecter is open-source MIT, a unified application maximizes value for the community.

## 📋 Summary of Value Proposition

By implementing these features, **NetSpecter** transitions from a simple *discovery* scanner into a **comprehensive Network Operations and Security Auditing Platform**. Combined with Burp Suite-class web application testing under a single multi-workspace UI, it would allow engineers to completely replace disjointed CLI tools (Nmap, Nikto, DirBuster, Wireshark, SNMPwalk, Burp, ffuf, sqlmap) with a single, visually appealing, and highly efficient desktop application spanning both **network-layer** and **application-layer** security testing.
